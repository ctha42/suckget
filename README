suckget
============================
A (semi) suckless file downloader

Usage
-----------
suckget takes a URL as an argument, It is snatched using libcurl and then printed to stdout, what you do with your output is up to you.

Build
-----------
I've tested this project under WSL and msys2, it should work equally well (if not better) under real *nix targets as well. Running make in the project directory should be sufficient.
